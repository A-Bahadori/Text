feat(owin): add OWIN support to the project

This MR adds OWIN support to the project, enabling integration with OWIN middleware for handling HTTP requests and responses.

### Key Changes:
- Added OWIN packages (`Microsoft.Owin`, `Microsoft.Owin.Host.SystemWeb`, etc.) to the project.
- Created a `Startup` class to configure OWIN middleware.
- Integrated OWIN with the existing ASP.NET pipeline for enhanced flexibility.
- Configured basic middleware to demonstrate OWIN functionality.

### Benefits:
- Provides a foundation for using OWIN middleware in the project.
- Enables future extensibility with additional OWIN-based features (e.g., authentication, logging).
- Improves modularity by decoupling application logic from the hosting environment.

### How to Test:
1. Run the application locally using IIS or IIS Express.
2. Navigate to the configured endpoint (e.g., `/` or `/api/hello`).
3. Verify that the response matches the expected output (e.g., "Hello from OWIN!").

### Notes:
- Ensure all dependencies are installed via NuGet before running the application.
- This implementation integrates OWIN with the existing ASP.NET pipeline and does not use a pure self-hosted setup.
