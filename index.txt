This MR migrates the `WebApp.csproj` file to the new SDK-style project format. This change modernizes the project structure and aligns it with current .NET standards, improving maintainability and compatibility.

### Key Changes:
- Converted `WebApp.csproj` to the SDK-style project format.
- Updated project dependencies and configurations to match the new format.
- Configured the output path to use `bin/` instead of `bin/net472` by disabling `AppendTargetFrameworkToOutputPath`.
- Ensured seamless integration with OWIN middleware in the new project structure.

### Important Notes for Reviewers and Developers:
1. **Cleaning and Rebuilding the Project:**
   - After pulling the latest changes from source control, please ensure that you:
     - Delete the `bin` and `obj` folders from the project directory.
     - Rebuild the project to regenerate these folders and resolve potential build issues.

2. **Run/Debug Configuration:**
   - To run the project, you need to create a custom Run/Debug configuration in your IDE (e.g., Visual Studio or JetBrains Rider) with the following settings:
     - **Type:** .NET Executable
     - **Exe Path:** `C:/Program Files (x86)/IIS Express/iisexpress.exe`
     - **Program Arguments:** `/config:"Your Project Path\.idea\config\applicationhost.config" /site:"WebApp"`
     - **Working Directory:** `C:/Program Files (x86)/IIS Express`

### Additional Context:
- The migration to SDK-style projects is part of an effort to modernize the solution and improve maintainability.
- OWIN functionality has been tested and works seamlessly with the new project structure.
- If you encounter any issues during testing, please report them in the comments section of this MR.
