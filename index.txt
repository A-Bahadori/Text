Description
This merge request adds a custom `applicationhost.config` file to configure IIS Express for running the project. The changes ensure that the project operates with the specific settings required for our development environment.

Changes Made
- Added a custom `applicationhost.config` file at `D:\Sink\WebApp\applicationhost.config`.
- Configured the project to use this file for IIS Express execution.

Usage Instructions
To run the project with the custom configuration, please follow these steps:

1. Program Arguments:
   - Set the program arguments in your IDE's Run/Debug configuration to reference the custom config file. Example:
/config:D:\Sink\WebApp\applicationhost.config /site:WebApp


2. Environment Variables:
- In the Run/Debug configuration, set the `AppPath` environment variable as follows:
AppPath=D:\Sink\WebApp
