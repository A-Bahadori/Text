refactor(Program.cs): streamline minimal API endpoint configuration

- Remove redundant `app.Run` and commented-out code (`//1`, `//2`, `//3`).
- Consolidate multiple endpoint definitions into a single `MapGet` with async/await.
- Align with .NET 8 minimal API best practices by simplifying response handling.
