refactor(webapp): migrate WebApp.csproj to SDK-style format with a known OWIN issue


This MR migrates the `WebApp.csproj` file to the new SDK-style project format. While this change improves the project structure and aligns it with modern .NET standards, an issue has been identified where OWIN functionality no longer works as expected.

### Key Changes:
- Converted `WebApp.csproj` to the SDK-style project format.
- Updated project dependencies and configurations to match the new format.

### Known Issue:
After migrating to the SDK-style format, OWIN middleware does not function correctly. This issue is currently under investigation.

### Important Notes for Reviewers and Developers:
1. **Cleaning and Rebuilding the Project:**
   - After pulling the latest changes from source control, please ensure that you:
     - Delete the `bin` and `obj` folders from the project directory.
     - Rebuild the project to regenerate these folders and resolve potential build issues.

2. **Run/Debug Configuration:**
   - To run the project, you need to create a custom Run/Debug configuration in your IDE (e.g., Visual Studio or JetBrains Rider) with the following settings:
     - **Type:** .NET Executable
     - **Exe Path:** `C:/Program Files (x86)/IIS Express/iisexpress.exe`
     - **Program Arguments:** `/config:"Your Project Path\.idea\config\applicationhost.config" /site:"WebApp"`
     - **Working Directory:** `C:/Program Files (x86)/IIS Express`

### Next Steps:
- The OWIN issue will be addressed in a follow-up task.
- Please test the project thoroughly after applying the above steps to ensure compatibility with the new SDK-style format.

### Additional Context:
- The migration to SDK-style projects is part of an effort to modernize the solution and improve maintainability.
- If you encounter any issues during testing, please report them in the comments section of this MR.
